# accretionflowproperties
Computes properties of the accretion flow onto a forming gas giant

## Assumptions
In the current version, we assume
1. Spherical symmetry
2. Free-streaming shock temperature everywhere ([Paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605869M), Eq. (33))
3. Equal temperatures before and after the shock
4. No dissociation or ionisation

This means that the temperature in the flow could be a bit larger if kappa\*rho\*r is large. Assumption 1. is of course not realistic far from the planet. Assumption 3. has always been seen to hold up to now.

Note that the shock temperature is independent of Assumption 4 but that dissociation or ionisation will change somewhat the temperature structure and the luminosity in the flow.

## Running
To run, call (broken up on two lines just for display purposes!)
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk -v dMdt=<dM/dt (ME/yr)>  -v MP=<Mp (MJ)>  \
    -v RP=<Rp (RJ)>  -v Ld=<Ldownstr (Lsol)> -v Ra=<Racc (RJ)>
```
i.e., for example,
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk -vdMdt=1e-2 -vMP=1 -vRP=2 -vLd=0 -vRa=123
```
The user needs to pick a (reasonable) accretion radius `Ra`. There are a few numerical parameters in the code but nothing very important.

with the exception of the flow time between two points, which comes from the integral of `dt = dr / v`
with `v = sqrt(2 G MP (1/r - 1/Ra)`. (An appropriate change of variables is needed for the integral...
