# accretionflowproperties
Computes properties of the accretion flow onto a forming gas giant

## Assumptions
In the current version, we assume
1. Spherical symmetry
2. Free-streaming shock temperature everywhere ([Paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605869M), Eq. (33))
3. Equal temperatures before and after the shock
4. No dissociation or ionisation

This means that the temperature in the flow could be a bit larger if kappa\*rho\*r is large. Assumption 1 is of course not realistic far from the planet. Assumption 3 has always been seen to hold up to now.

Note that the shock temperature is independent of Assumption 4 (except perhaps for rare cases; Marleau et al., in prep.) but that dissociation or ionisation will change somewhat the temperature structure and the luminosity in the flow.

## Execution
To run, call (shown on two lines just for display purposes)
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk  -v dMdt=<dM/dt (ME/yr)>  -v MP=<Mp (MJ)>  \
    -v RP=<Rp (RJ)>  -v Ld=<Ldownstr (Lsol)>  -v Ra=<Racc (RJ)>
```
i.e., for example,
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk -vdMdt=1e-2 -vMP=1 -vRP=2 -vLd=0 -vRa=123
```
(With `awk`, `-v x=1` or `-vx=1` sets the variable `x`.) The user needs to pick a (reasonable) accretion radius `Ra`. There are a few parameters in the script. Most are minor but the time zero location makes some difference (try changing it).

Reasonable parameter combinations are maybe
- Ld = 0--1e-2 # Lsol (0 is probably usually more relevant)
- dMdt = 1e-4--1e-2 # ME/an
- MP = 1--10 # MJ
- RP = 1.5--3 # RJ

**Reminder**: The output of the script, in particular the temperature, will be approximate (in fact, most likely a lower bound)
because both the formulae (spherical symmetry and even then, simple result only;
in [Paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605869M) we give a more exact result)
but also the input (parameter values) are approximate.

with the exception of the flow time between two points, which comes from the integral of `dt = dr / v`
with `v = sqrt(2 G MP (1/r - 1/Ra)`. (An appropriate change of variables is needed for the integral...
