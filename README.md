# accretionflowproperties
Computes approximate properties of the accretion flow onto a forming gas giant:
density, temperature, velocity as a function of radius and time since the beginning
of the fall.

_by Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Universität Tübingen_

The main file is [accretionflowproperties.awk](accretionflowproperties.awk).

## Assumptions

In the current version for the planetary shock case, we assume:
1. Spherical symmetry
2. Equal temperatures before and after the shock
3. No dissociation nor ionisation

2. Free-streaming shock temperature everywhere ([Paper II](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...881..144M), Eq. (33))

- Assumption 1 is of course not realistic far from the planet.
- Assumption 2 has always been seen to hold up to now.
- The shock temperature is independent of Assumption 3 (except perhaps for rare cases; Marleau et al., in prep.) but that dissociation or ionisation will change somewhat the temperature structure and the luminosity in the flow.

In the current version (v.2), we now take roughly into account the effect of the dust opacity, which is important if locally kappa\*rho\*r is >~ 1; this will typically be the case below the dust destruction tempeature (see Paper II, e.g., Fig. 7). Given the uncertainties in the dust model, we use a constant kappa = 3 cm^2/g (cross-section per gram of _gas_). Caveat emptor: the simple smoothing used here (instead of actual solving implicity) has not been tested extensively!


## Input and output
The input quantities are:
- filling factor ffill
- accretion rate dM/dt
- planet mass MP
- planet radius = shock position RP
- downstream luminosity Ld
- accretion radius Ra

Ld is the luminosity left of the shock = internal luminosity + post-shock compression of the material,
and needs to be determined by some other means; taking Ld=0 (in the sense << L_acc) is usually fine.
See also [Berardo et al. (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834..149B).

Ra is the "accretion radius" in the sense that v_free-fall(r) = sqrt[ 2 G MP * (1/r - 1/Ra) ].

The output quantities are, as a function of time or position:
- time since the accretion radius (this makes the script slow; can be deactivated)
- radial position (distance from planet centre)
- density
- temperature
- velocity
- crude estimates of the time coordinate, only for comparison
- local free-fall time


## Execution
To run, call (shown on two lines just for display purposes)
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk  -v ffill=<ffill>  -v dMdt=<dM/dt (ME/yr)>  -v MP=<Mp (MJ)>  \
    -v RP=<Rp (RJ)>  -v Ld=<Ldownstr (Lsol)>  -v Ra=<Racc (RJ)>
```
i.e., for example,
```
./accretionflowproperties.awk -vffill=1 -vdMdt=1e-2 -vMP=1 -vRP=2 -vLd=0 -vRa=123
```
(With `awk`, `-v x=33` or `-vx=33` assigns the value 33 to the variable `x`.) The output will be printed to screen.

The user needs to pick a (reasonable) accretion radius `Ra`. There are a few parameters in the script. Most are minor but the time zero location makes some difference (try changing it).

Reasonable parameter combinations are maybe
- `ffill = 0.01--1` (1: spherically symmetric; 0.01: magnetospheric accretion)
- `Ld = 0--1e-2 # Lsol` (0 is probably usually more relevant)
- `dMdt = 1e-4--1e-2 # ME/an`
- `MP = 1--10 # MJ`
- `RP = 1.5--3 # RJ`


See also [Mordasini et al. (2017), "Characterization of exoplanets from their formation. III. The statistics of planetary luminosities"](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...608A..72M) for an idea of what internal luminosities could be during formation.

**Reminder**: The output of the script, in particular the temperature, will be approximate (in fact, most likely a lower bound)
because both the formulae (spherical symmetry and even then, simple result only;
in [Paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605869M) we give a more exact result)
but also the input (parameter values) are approximate.

with the exception of the flow time between two points, which comes from the integral of `dt = dr / v`
with `v = sqrt(2 G MP (1/r - 1/Ra))`. (An appropriate change of variables is needed for the integral...
